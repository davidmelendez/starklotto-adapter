name: Next.js CI

# NOTE: Split workflow - Next.js CI runs automatically, Contracts CI runs manually only
#
# WORKFLOW STRUCTURE:
# 1. nextjs-ci job: Runs automatically on Next.js changes or manual dispatch
# 2. compile-contracts job: Runs ONLY when manually triggered with workflow_dispatch
#
# This prevents automatic snforge test execution while allowing manual contract compilation
#
# MANUAL EXECUTION:
# - Go to Actions tab in GitHub
# - Select "Next.js CI" workflow
# - Click "Run workflow" button
# - This runs both Next.js CI and Cairo contract compilation
#
# IMPORTANT: No automatic snforge test execution occurs in this workflow
